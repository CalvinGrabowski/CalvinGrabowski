### 📌 Featured Projects
### [Spotify Playlist Analyzer (AI/ML)](https://github.com/CalvinGrabowski/Spotify-Playlist-Analyzer-ML-Project)
- Built a web app that classifies playlist mood using a trained machine learning model
- Retrieved track data via Spotipy and audio features via RapidAPI
- Generated playlist-level mood predictions and returned results via a FastAPI backend
- Visualized mood distributions using Matplotlib

### [Fall Term AI Project (AI/ML)](https://github.com/CalvinGrabowski/Fall_Term_AI_Project)
- Implemented a machine learning model used in the Spotify Playlist Analyzer
- Gained hands-on experience with supervised learning and feature engineering
- Collaborated through the OSU AI Club to design and execute a term-long AI project

### Future Project (In Progress)
### [EdgeGuard Hybrid Intelligence](https://github.com/3EEEs/EdgeGuard-Hybrid-Intelligence)
- Role: API & Cloud Integration Lead
- Designing an edge-based video monitoring system that filters motion locally before cloud processing
- Building an AWS pipeline using S3, Lambda, and Amazon Rekognition to analyze motion-triggered frames
- Reducing cloud costs by selectively uploading only relevant frames or short clips instead of full video streams
- Developing a backend API to surface AI detection results (people, animals, objects) to a web dashboard
- Collaborating in a team using GitHub Projects, pull requests, and code reviews
